# Arduino_Maze_Solver
A University Semester Project for the Measures and Convertors subject
In this project I created a semi-autonomous robot powered by a Arduino Nano, capable to move forward, detect obstacles and pick another route to proceed (left or right) using an ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servomotor. Uses an "Always-left" algorithm to solve a classic maze.
